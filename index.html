      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Melany Gonzalez and I'm a Venezuelan born and raised in Miami. <br>

        <br>

      <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I first took a Computer Science class when I was in eighth grade. <br> I wasn't great but I knew that I wanted to keep practicing. 
        After taking AP Computer Science Principles, I looked for different ways I could work on projects. <br> Over the summer before my
        senior year of high school, I participated in Kode with Klossy's Data Science camp and got inspired to use Data Science for good.
        Now I am double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a second-year student at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Data Science. 
        I have earned Dean's List in Winter 2025 and Spring 2025.
        <br>
        I graduated Magna Cum Laude at Doral Academy Preparatory in 2024. I also dual enrolled at Miami Dade College 
        and earned my Associate's Degree with Highest Honors before graduating high school.

      <h2>Involvement</h2>
      <p>
        I'm involved with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers as Co-Chapter Liaison. 
        In this role, I get to facilitate collaboration between SHPE and other organizations on campus. 
        Right now, I am coordinating our chapter's trip to the SHPE national convention in Philadephia 
        in October! <br> I am also Technology Director of the Society of Women Engineers. As Tech Director, 
        I get to send out the SWEekly Announcements as well as work on our chapter's website.
        <br>
        I am also a Corp Member at Northwestern's Jumpstart. During the school year, I commute to a
        local preschool, help the students learn how to read, and assist the teachers. <br>I really enjoy
        working with the preschoolers and I plan on continuing to work for Jumpstart throughout the 
        rest of college.
